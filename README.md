# üîç Search Engine Project

> A full-stack search engine built with Java/Spring Boot backend and Vue.js frontend

## Project Overview

This is a high-performance search engine that crawls web pages, indexes content, calculates PageRank scores, and provides a modern web interface for searching. The system is designed with scalability and performance in mind, featuring multi-threaded crawling, efficient indexing, and intelligent ranking algorithms.


## ‚ú® Features
### üï∑Ô∏è Web Crawler

- **Multi-threaded Architecture**: Configurable thread pool (default: 20 threads)
- **High Performance**: Crawls 1000 documents in under 1 minute using 5 threads
- **Smart Batching**: Prioritizes popular pages using frequency-based batching
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Respects web server policies with robust caching
- **Duplicate Detection**: Content hashing prevents redundant processing
- **URL Normalization**: Standardizes and filters invalid URLs
- **Compression**: Stores crawled content efficiently

##### Optimization Techniques
- Uses documents compression and decompression to store data of much less size in the database for faster operations.
- The RobotsHandler implements a domain-based caching system, maps hostnames to parsed robots.txt rules, ensuring each domain's rules are fetched only once regardless of how many URLs from that domain are crawled.

### üßæ Indexer

> Transforms HTML documents into inverted indices for fast search

- **Advanced Tokenization**: Intelligent text processing and cleanup
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Removes common words for better relevance
- **Stemming Support**: Reduces words to their root forms
- **Field Extraction**: Processes titles, headers, and content separately
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized database operations

### üìä Ranking System

> Ranks pages based on their PageRank, TF, and IDF scores

- **TF-IDF** scoring for term relevance per page
- **Normalized PageRank** influence for domain authority
    - Using PageRank algorithm, which takes ~10ms on 6,000 documents
- **Structural field boosts** for `<title>` and `<h1>` tag matches
- **Penalty** applied for missing `<h1>` tags
- **Score capping** to avoid overinflation
- Computes PageRank as an **offline process** for all crawled URLs
- **Optimized database operations** for fetching & saving ranks,
    - targets: <200ms for 6,000 documents.
    - Ranking logic runs in **8~50ms** depending on query  


### üîç Query processing & Phrase Searching

> Processes user queries, supports phrase search, and generates result snippets.


- **Unified Tokenization**: Applies the same cleanup, stemming, and stop-word removal as the indexer to ensure consistency
- **Exact Phrase Search**: Supports precise phrase matching, even when stop words are present
- **Multi-threading**: Speeds up snippet generation and phrase matching
- **Fast Response Times**:
    - General query: **0.01 ‚Äì 0.2 seconds**
    - Phrase search: **< 0.3 seconds**

#### Optimization Techniques

- Snippet generation is triggered only when the corresponding result page is requested
- Uses token position lookup from the inverted index ‚Äî avoids full document scans (no regex!)
- Early filtering (before stemming) to narrow down the result set for phrase searching queries

#### Flow

## üìù Development Guidelines
- Follow the conventions outlined in `Project-Guidelines.md`


## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **MongoDB** must be running locally 
- **Maven** should be installed and available in your terminal
- Ensure your `application.properties` file is properly configured
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project root directory
### Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd engine
    ```
    
2. Run Spring Boot
    
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    
---

To start each module **in order**:


1. Run the Crawler (default thread count is 20)

```bash
make crawl THREADS=10
```

2. Run the Indexer

```bash
make index
```

3. Run the PageRank Module

```bash
make pagerank
```

4, Run the Ranker (with an optional query)

```bash
make rank QUERY="your search terms"
```

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and go to the frontend directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3. Start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
4. Open your browser and visit: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)
